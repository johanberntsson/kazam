Kazam works on source files. When opening a source file it is read into
memory. Every change in editors like the room editor or the property pages
is directly inserted in the memory copy of the source file. The memory copy
will be save to file when the user selects Save. The status of all source files
will be checked before Build, and any updated sources will be written to
file before compiling.
