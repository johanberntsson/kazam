<H2>Introduction</H2>

Kazam is a visual editor and project manager for interactive game creation with Inform.
It is developed with the wxWindows cross-platform GUI package, and there will be versions
for Linux and Macintosh available once the program is stable.<P>
Kazam operates on Inform source files. When opening a source file it is read into
memory. Every change in editors like the room editor or the property pages is directly
inserted in the memory copy of the source file. The memory copy will be save to file
when the user selects Save. The status of all source files will be checked before Build,
and any updated sources will be written to file before compiling. <P>
