<H3>Map View</H3>

From the map view all rooms can be displayed and edited. The Map menu will be inserted
in the menu bar whenever this room is active, and from it you can add and delete rooms
and connections. You can also modify the canvas size and zoom in and out.<P>
Auto arrange will relocate all rooms to locations based on their connections, as defined
by n_to etc in the objects themselves. Some manual modifications will probably be required,
but it is a good way of providing reasonable defaults when importing files that
don't have location information into Kazam.<P>
